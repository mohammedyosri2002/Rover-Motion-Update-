project involves controlling a device with five basic states: forward, backward, right, left, and stop, along with five additional sub-states for controlling the speed from maximum to minimum. These states will be selected via Bluetooth communication, where receiving a message will indicate the desired mode, and sending a message will confirm the selected mode.
project concept:
Basic States:
Forward
Backward
Right
Left
Stop
Sub-States for Speed Control:
Very High Speed
High Speed
Medium Speed
Low Speed
Very Low Speed
Communication Method:

Bluetooth communication will be used to send and receive messages indicating the desired state or speed level.
Control Flow:

Upon receiving a message via Bluetooth, the device will interpret the message to determine the desired state or speed level.
Based on the received message, the device will enter the corresponding state or adjust its speed accordingly.
After processing the received message, the device will send a confirmation message back via Bluetooth to acknowledge the selected mode.
